# JERP 3.0 Pricing Guide

## Overview
JERP 3.0 offers transparent, affordable pricing designed specifically for construction contractors. Plans are based on the number of **employees** (not users), giving you the flexibility to grow without worrying about license costs.

## Why Employee-Based Pricing?
Unlike traditional software that charges per "user seat," JERP 3.0 charges based on employees because:
- **More Fair**: You only pay for the people you're managing, not every person who logs in
- **Construction-Focused**: Contractors think in terms of employees, not software users
- **Predictable**: As your workforce grows, your costs scale proportionally
- **Flexible**: Multiple managers can access the system without extra cost
