## Target Market

### Primary: Small to Mid-Size Construction Contractors

- **Traditional ERP:** $100-150 per user/month × 20 users = $2,000-3,000/month
- **JERP 3.0:** $299/month for up to 50 employees = Flat rate

## Founding Story

**Built by Julio Cesar Mendez Tobar Jr.**

**Why I Built This:**
I spent 10+ years in construction project management, always frustrated by:
- Software that costs more than a crew member's salary
- Systems built by software companies who don't understand construction
- Tools that require IT departments to maintain

So I taught myself to code and built the system I always wanted:
- Affordable enough for any contractor
- Powerful enough for prevailing wage and certified payroll
- Simple enough that crew foremen can use it

**Education:**
- Business Administration - Universidad de El Salvador
- Construction Project Management - UC Davis
- Self-taught developer

**Mission:** Make professional construction management software accessible to contractors who can't afford $50,000/year systems.
